  "description": "Design and implement a single-cycle MiniRISC processor in SystemVerilog or Verilog. The processor must support arithmetic, logic, immediate, branch, and jump instructions as defined in the provided specification document. For this challenge, evaluation will focus only on functional correctness. Performance, area, and power will be considered in future challenges.",
